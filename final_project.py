# ‚Ä¢ The user should be able to view immediate feedback for each question (Correct/Incorrect)

# ‚Ä¢ The user should be able to see their final score at the end of the quiz

# ‚Ä¢ The user's score should be saved to a .txt file for record-keeping


# A dictionary that already has 10 questions stored. The dictionary is required to have a total of 10 question.

#Quiz questions that students can answer, and it provides the correct answer
